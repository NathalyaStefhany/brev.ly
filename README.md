## ðŸ“‘ About

Brev.ly is a FullStack URL shortening application, developed as part of my **PÃ³s Tech Developer 360** postgraduate course at **Rocketseat**. The project aims to create a platform that allows the registration, listing, and removal of shortened links, as well as generating reports with the number of accesses for each link. The application also ensures the correct redirection of shortened links to their original URLs, providing a practical and efficient solution to optimize link sharing and monitor the generated traffic.

<br/>

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Shortened link registration:** allows the user to quickly and easily create short links from long URLs.

- **Link listing:** displays all the shortened links registered in the system for easy access and viewing.

- **Link removal:** provides the option to delete shortened links simply and efficiently.

- **Access reports:** generates reports with the number of accesses for each link, which can be exported to CSV format for detailed analysis.

- **Redirection:** ensures that shortened links correctly redirect users to the original URLs.
